            Designers are using 3D printing to create
            <span>unique customizable garments</span> and accessories. This
            technology allows for intricate designs that would be difficult to
            produce with traditional methods, and it also reduces waste by
            enabling on-demand production.

            VR and AR are transforming the shopping experience by allowing
            customers to virtually try on clothes or accessories. Virtual
            fitting rooms and AR-powered apps help shoppers visualize how an
            outfit looks on them without physically trying it on, improving
            convenience and reducing returns.
